Sorry for the delay, for some reason this message went to my spam
folder, anyway the problem we have is that we are not processing
notification while MTU exchange is pending, please try with the

Subject: [PATCH BlueZ] core/device: Fix not handling notification

attio callbacks needs to be triggered as soon as possible once connected
otherwise profiles such as HoG may miss notification that are sent while
bt_gatt_client is doing MTU exchange.
